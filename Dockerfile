# Packages installed:
# git; Used to pull in particular requirements from github rather than pypi, 
# and to check the sha of the code checkout.

# ppa:deadsnakes/ppa; since Ubuntu doesn't ship with python 3.8 till 20, we need deadsnakes to install
# python 3.8 on older ubuntu versions

# language-pack-en locales; ubuntu locale support so that system utilities have a consistent
# language and time zone.

# python3.8-dev; to install python 3.8
# python3-venv; installs venv module required to create virtual environments

# libssl-dev; # mysqlclient wont install without this.

# libmysqlclient-dev; to install header files needed to use native C implementation for 
# MySQL-python for performance gains.
# software-properties-common; to get apt-add-repository
# deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.8
# If you add a package here please include a comment above describing what it is used for
