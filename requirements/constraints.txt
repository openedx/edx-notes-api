# Version constraints for pip installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# We are creating a local copy of the common constraints file and override/remove the global constraint which we don't need.
# This approach is used temporarily and will be improved in https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/BOM-2721
# This file contains all common constraints for edx-repos

# PyJWT[crypto] 2.0.0 has a number of breaking changes that we are
# actively working to fix. A number of the active constraints are all related
# to this effort. Additionally, your IDA/service may also be affected directly
# by these changes. You should not upgrade without knowing what you are doing.
