# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints

# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# PyJWT[crypto] 2.0.0 has a number of breaking changes that we are
# actively working to fix. A number of the active constraints are all related
# to this effort. Additionally, your IDA/service may also be affected directly
# by these changes. You should not upgrade without knowing what you are doing.
