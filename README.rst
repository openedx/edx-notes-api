edX Student Notes API |build-status|
====================================

This is a backend store for edX Student Notes.

Overview
--------

The edX Notes API is designed to be compatible with the `Annotator <http://annotatorjs.org/>`__.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install `ElasticSearch 7.8.0 <https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-7-8-0-released>`__.

2. Install the requirements:

   ::

       $ make develop

3. Create index and put mapping:

   ::

       $ make create-index

4. Run the server:

   ::

       $ make run

Configuration:
--------------

``CLIENT_ID`` - OAuth2 Client ID, which is to be found in ``aud`` field of IDTokens which authorize users

``CLIENT_SECRET`` - secret with which IDTokens should be encoded

``ES_DISABLED`` - set to True when you need to run the service without ElasticSearch support.
                  e.g if it became corrupted and you're rebuilding the index, while still serving users
                  through MySQL

``ELASTICSEARCH_DSL['default']['hosts']`` - Your ElasticSearch host

Running Tests
-------------

Run ``make validate`` install the requirements, run the tests, and run
lint.
