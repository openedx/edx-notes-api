edX Student Notes API |build-status| |coverage-status|
======================================================

This is a backend store for edX Student Notes.

Overview
--------

The edX Notes API is designed to be compatible with the `Annotator <http://annotatorjs.org/>`__.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install `ElasticSearch <http://elasticsearch.org>`__ 1.x.y.

2. Install the requirements:

   ::

       $ make develop

3. Create index and put mapping:

   ::

       $ make create-index

4. Run the server:

   ::

       $ make run

Configuration:
--------------

``CLIENT_ID`` - OAuth2 Client ID, which is to be found in ``aud`` field of IDTokens which authorize users

``CLIENT_SECRET`` - secret with which IDTokens should be encoded

``ES_DISABLED`` - set to True when you need to run the service without ElasticSearch support.
                  e.g if it became corrupted and you're rebuilding the index, while still serving users
                  through MySQL

``HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS['default']['url']`` - Your ElasticSearch URL

Running Tests
-------------

Run ``make validate`` install the requirements, run the tests, and run
lint.

How To Resync The Index
-----------------------
edX Notes Store uses `Haystack <http://haystacksearch.org/>`_ which comes with several management commands.

Please read more about ``update_index`` management command
`here <http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/latest/management_commands.html#update-index>`_.
